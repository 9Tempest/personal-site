I am a Bachelor of Mathematics at the University of Waterloo majoring in Computer Science. \n\nI love the system area of Computer Science, including Compilers, Operating Systems, Embedded Systems, Distributed Systems and etc. \n\nI love challenges, I conquered all the infamous ['Big Three'](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-challenging-courses-at-the-University-of-Waterloo-for-a-computer-science-major) Computer Science courses at the University of Waterloo  \n\nI love video games, I have played Dota2 for 2400 hours and HeartStone for 2000 wins. \n\nI love board games, ranging from Werewolf to mahjang. \n\n\n# Travel / Geography\n\nMy home town is in KunShan, China, and I am also a traveling lover. \n\nIn China, I have traveled to SuZhou, Nanjing, Anhui, Wuxi, ChangShu, HangZhou, ShaoXing, ZhouShan, Beijing, Xiamen, Hainan, Chengdu, Sichuan, Wuhan, Harbin, Shanxi, Shandong.\n\nIn Canada, I have traveled to Toronto, Calgary, Banff, Montreal, Old Quebec, Kingston.\n\nIn the U.S., I have traveled to NewYork, Boston.\n\nI have also traveled to Singapore, Thailand, and etc.\n\n# Reading\nTo expand my knowledge beyond the senior Compiler course, I have read [\"Modern Compiler Implementation in Java\"](https://www.amazon.ca/Modern-Compiler-Implementation-Andrew-Appel/dp/052182060X) and the [dragon book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools), learning about advanced topics like instruction-level parallelism and Polyhedral Loop Optimization. Here are some paper that I have read:\n- *LLVM: A Compilation Framework for Lifelong Program Analysis & Transformation* by Chris Lattner Vikram Adv*\n- *A Data Locality Optimizing Algorithm* by Michael E. Wolf and Monica S. Lam\n- *The theory of deadlock avoidance via discrete control* by Yin Wang St\xb4ephane Lafortune, Terence Kelly, Manjunath Kudlur and Scott Mahlke\n- *Uncovering Hidden Loop Level Parallelism in Sequential Applications* by Hongtao Zhong, Mojtaba Mehrara, Steve Lieberman and Scott Mahlke\n\n# I dream of\n\n- always finding inspiration.\n- enabling a brighter future.\n- doing better.\n\n",d=h.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,c=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return(0,s.jsx)(t.rU,(0,o.Z)({},n))};n.default=function(){return(0,s.jsx)(l.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Luke Zhu",children:(0,s.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,s.jsx)("header",{children:(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,s.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,s.jsx)(t.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,s.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),(0,s.jsx)(r(),{source:h,renderers:{Link:c},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
